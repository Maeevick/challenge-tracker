## Context

I had to stop workouts during the last 3 months, results are sad:

- Loss of Strength.
- Loss of Muscle.
- Gain of Fat.
- Stable Weight (74-75kg for 1.80m).

## Objectives

- 1️⃣ Restore Strength and Endurance.
- 2️⃣ Restore Self-Esteem and Well-Being.
- 3️⃣ Lose Fat and Weight (readjusting food meanwhile).

## Ambitions (on December 31, 2024)

- 1️⃣ Compound Pyramid Workout of "Double 5".
- 2️⃣ ~ 10-12% of Fat Mass.
- 3️⃣ <= 72kg.

## Constraints

- Work exclusively on rings.
- I don't have more than 20min per day, so I workout 1 full body session 4 to 6 times a week.

### What's "Compound Pyramid Workout of Double 5"?

Pyramid X is a set, without break, of: 1 rep + 2 rep + 3 rep ... + X rep + ... 3 rep + 2 rep + 1 rep.

-> "Double 5" is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1, resulting in 1 set of 30 reps.

Instead of doing traditional pyramid (one exercise per pyramid at a time: pull-up, push-up, ...), I have more fun by compounding them in a mini circuit.

Contrary to traditional set & rep, the compound pyramid is more exhausting and trains both strength and endurance.

-> My "compound mini-circuit" is:

- ring pull-up
- leg raises
- assisted pistol squat
- pike push-up
- diamond push-up
- hamstring curl
- inverted row

_Note: currently I'm ok with a "Double 3" (12 reps of each in 1 continuous set)_
